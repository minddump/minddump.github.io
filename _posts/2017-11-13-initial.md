## Initial

Hi, this is yet another one developer's blog with the purpose of sharing some thoughts
and ideas, improvements and failures, philosophizing and just having a good time writing it.

Many good things were born spontaneously so let's see where it goes.

Just a couple of today's thoughts to justify the proud name that I've just made up.
### AI
AI is taking over the world and it's quite obvious that one can't avoid dealing
with this fact. It's only a matter of time when our lives change drastically.
So there are two behavior models for a developer that I see:
to start digging deep into the tech stack right now in order to
be skilled enough and find a place for yourself in this new world or
to start making a product fumbling the possibility of creating and controlling
the piece of artificial mind. What would I choose... I like both of them.
### Time
Time is running. The older you are the faster it goes and you move faster with it.
You have to. This planet shouldn't get asleep ever.
